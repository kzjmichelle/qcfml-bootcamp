# Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn and Tensorflow
### Revamped version of workshop done by Nuyun Zhang (nuyun@gatech.edu) at Georgia Tech.  

In the workshop, you will learn basics of different machine learning algorithms and learn how to implement them using Scikit-learn and Tensorflow.

## Scikit-learn (Iris Dataset)
* K-means Clustering 
* K-Nearest Neighbors Classification 
* Logistic Regression 
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machine


## Tensorflow 
* Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

For each topic theory is explained in Markdown of Jupyter Notebook file.
